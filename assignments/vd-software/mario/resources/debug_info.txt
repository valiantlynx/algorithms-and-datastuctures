# Debugging Mario Game

## Common Issues:

1. "Failed to create input context for window" error
   - This often happens with certain window managers or when running in some virtual environments
   - Solution: The game should continue to work despite this warning, keyboard input should still function
   - If keyboard input doesn't work, try running with sudo or check your X11 permissions

2. Blue screen with white grid
   - This indicates that the textures aren't loading properly
   - Check that all resource files are in the correct location
   - The game should create placeholder textures if files are missing
   - Verify the file paths in Game.cpp's loadTextures() function

3. Game crashes when hitting blocks
   - If you're seeing segmentation faults when mario hits blocks, it may be due to missing textures
   - The code assumes textures are available for coins and mushrooms
   - Empty vectors of coins/mushrooms can cause crashes

## Files to Check:

1. Resources folder should contain:
   - mario_sprites.png
   - blocks.png
   - coin.png
   - mushroom.png
   - background.png
   - flag.png
   - arial.ttf
   - Sound files (.wav)

2. If using placeholder textures:
   - Make sure the code properly creates placeholders for all required textures
   - Check console output for "Failed to load" messages

## To Fix Input Context Error:

```bash
# On Ubuntu, you might need:
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Or try running the game with:
DISPLAY=:0 ./mario
```
